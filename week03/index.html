            This weeks readings were mainly about the connection between man and machine. Since the start of the world wide web,
            there have been an open door of access, as well as limitations for the users.

            In Bush's As We May Think, he is able to predict the future of technology in the 10 years between the writing of
            this article and my reading of it.
