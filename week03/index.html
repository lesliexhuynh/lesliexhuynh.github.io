            This weeks readings were mainly about the connection between man and technology. Since technology started to
            evolve in the mid 1900s, there have been an open door of access, as well as limitations for the people who use 
            it.

            In Bush's As We May Think, he is able to predict the future of technology in the 75 years between the writing of
            this article and my reading of it. He discussed a "calculating device", which I assume is the modern day calculator.
            He also discusses the amount of growing research there is in science, and how even though there is so much information,
            it's nearly impossible to be able to completely learn anything from it since there is so much. That connects to how
            much access we have today on the web, but there is an endless stream of information, so no human would be able to consume
            everything the internet has to offer.

            Berners Lee's Long Live the Web discusses the start of the World Wide Web and it's evolution. He wrote his piece in 2010, 
            on the 20th anniversary of the WWW. The web evovled so much from 1990 to 2010, and even more drastically from 2010 to 2020. 
            Even back then, Lee estimated the foes of the web, from the government to corporations trying to control and manipualte
            the internet and it's users information. There was a new set of laws that had to exist to protect humans when they are
            in the virtual world.
