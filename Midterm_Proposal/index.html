   <h1>Leslie's Midterm Proposal</h1>
  
</div>
<p> Proposal:
  My midterm site idea is for a site based around the BTS. When I was learning about them 4 years
  ago, all the sites with info about them were simple and not very well formatted, and it's still like that now. 
  I want to create a site with pages for each of the members and as much of a breakdown
  on the band itself as I can.
